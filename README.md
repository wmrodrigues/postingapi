# postingapi

Hey there! Thank you for visiting here, I hope you find what you're looking for and have a great time.

This is a test project, a web api that responds to some REST verbs, GET, POST and DELETE. The endpoints in here were develop just to fulfill the requirements of the specification document.

This project was develop using:
- PHP 7 (accurately 7.0.10)
- Lumen/Laravel framwork (https://lumen.laravel.com/)
- PostgreSQL database x64 10  (https://www.postgresql.org/)

To help you test the project, you can use the file postingapi.postman_collection.json that is within the project files, just on the directory root. You just have to import it on a Postman application (by Google) and call the requests.

Also, the project have a Seeding file to help with some initial data, ../postingapi/database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php

I really hope you have fun.
